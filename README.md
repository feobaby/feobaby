### Hi there 👋🏾

- ➡️ My name is Funmi, which is short for Funmilayo. I'm a software engineer with a knack for exploring various ventures that have contributed to the success of numerous projects! I also really love teaching, writing, and mentoring so much!
- 🖋️ Recently, I completed my Master of Mathematics in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.
-  🔭 I’m currently working on an app for my favorite all-time party game called Mafia. Basically, it will act as the game coordinator.
- 🌱 As of now, I can speak three languages really well, which are English, Yoruba, and French. I am still really working on my French, though.
- 💬 Ask me about computer science topics, career paths, and schools!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love **YouTube** a lot. I believe it's one of the most valuable products in the world, followed by **Reddit**
- 🕸️ I had a tech blog on Hashnode called: [Ferns](https://ferns.hashnode.dev/), but now I have moved away from Hashnode to Substack and the new blog name is called: [Fernsology](https://fernsology.substack.com/). You can catch the full gist on why -> [here](https://blog.funmiolaiya.com/im-no-longer-on-hashnode-heres-why).
- I am obsessed with my [website](https://funmiolaiya.com/) and [portfolio](https://portfolio.funmiolaiya.com/), it is so ME. 💃
